  background: There are an estimated 4.5 billion mobile phone users across the globe,
    yet approximately 80% of the world’s population has no reliable way to call for
    help in the event of a life-threatening illness or injury. Nonetheless, lack of
    access to basic emergency health care services is a major contributor to health
    disparities between developed and developing nations with low- and middle-income
    countries having substantially higher mortality rates for what would otherwise
    be considered preventable deaths.
  shortDescription: BEACON is a text message-based emergency medical dispatching software
    created by Trek Medics International, and designed specifically for communities
    where consistent ambulance response is not available. By relaying text messages
    from the scene of an emergency to trained responders throughout the community,
    the software enables the nearest available emergency care providers to quickly
    locate, treat and transport emergency victims to local hospitals.
  impact: Our goal is to ensure that 90% of victims requesting emergency assistance
    through the communities we work will be attended to by trained layperson responders
    with access to transport within 10 minutes in urban centers and within 30 minutes
    in peripheral communities. We believe that the minimal human, physical and financial
    resources associated with a text message-based emergency medical dispatch system
    will make the implementation of prehospital care systems possible wherever mobile
    phones are used, providing a sustainable and cost-effective model for other low-resource
    settings.

  background: The U.S. lacks an efficient process for disseminating environmental
    information. People need information to make environmental decisions. The public
    is left depending on corporations and government entities to make environmental
    decisions for them. U.S. citizens rely on a combination of FOIA and some environmental
    law provisions to obtain environmental information which is problematic because
    information is hard to find and understand, FOIA exemptions block access and create
    delays, and agencies use outdated technology. The U.S. part of the Rio Convention,
    which requires parties to give people access to environmental information, but
    U.S. currently fails to do so effectively.
  shortDescription: Right now, environmental information is hard to get, and even
    harder to understand and use. Green Archives will be a well-established source
    for environmental information. It will also go beyond basic information access,
    connecting people with individuals and organizations that can help them ¨translate”
    the complex jargon of environmental information and link them to others interested
    in environmental advocacy and action related to the information they seek. Through
    environmental information access and online connection opportunities, Green Archives
    will connect localized communities with wider networks that may help facilitate
    legislative, judicial, or regulatory community work to face the environmental
    issue at hand.
  impact: This project helps information seekers to obtain and decode environmental
    information as both a functional tool and a vision of what government information
    access in the U.S. could be by providing environmental information gathered from
    proactive FOIA disclosures and FOIA request responses from federal agencies, and
    creating a space for experts to assist information seekers in understanding the
    information contained in the FOIA records. Finally, environmental advocates can
    use the space to find others sharing interests in the same environmental issues.

  background: Linq, the Innovation Lab at the city of Quito, is a space for reinventing
    governance. We see Linq as filling up the -thus far empty- area between civil
    society and local government for co-creating solutions to the most urgent urban
    challenges. We work in three main areas aligned to the Mayor's agenda concerning
    mobility, urban and social issues. We co-create virtually, through a networking-like
    web platform, and soon we will hold dynamic workshops with various interest groups
    to foster such relationships, spot innovative ideas and transform them into disruptive
    solutions.
  shortDescription: LINQ is a space for dialogue and direct collaboration between
    citizens, local and international organizations, colleges, as well as public and
    private sectors; with the purpose of co-creating high impact of solutions to our
    most pressing issues.
  impact: The expected impact of innovating in the public sector is uncertain. However,
    it is practically undeniable that life has greatly changed in the last two decades
    (mainly due to technology), yet government structures have remained virtually
    the same for the past 200 years. The impact of reinventing governance and adapting
    it to current times is thus expected to be immense.

  background: The Participatory Politics Foundation (PPF) is a 510(c)3 non-profit
    with a mission to increase civic engagement. Since 2006, PPF has built free, libre
    and open-source technology for open government and public accountability. In 2007,
    PPF’s flagship OpenCongress launched, and over the next eight years grew to become
    the most-visited non-profit site for tracking the U.S. Congress. PPF brought the
    OpenCongress model to state legislatures with OpenGovernment.org in 2011, and
    continual online conversation with the question-and-answers platform AskThem.io
    in 2014. Now, PPF’s primary project is Councilmatic.org, for city-level open government,
    with the Chicago-based civic tech company DataMade as tech leads. Councilmatic
    was created by Mjumbe Poe as a Code For America Fellow in Philadelphia in 2011
    as an open-source web app. In 2015, PPF and DataMade re-factored the Councilmatic
    open-source code to integrate with the Open Civic Data standard, making it easier
    to set up open-data versions of Councilmatic in more cities.
  shortDescription: 'NYC Councilmatic (http://nyc.councilmatic.org/) is a new website
    for tracking and understanding what’s happening in the NYC Council. It’s free,
    open-source, and has generated the first-ever open data on every legislative action
    in the NYC Council. Councilmatic is a non-profit and non-partisan public resource,
    from the NYC-based Participatory Politics Foundation. It works for individuals
    and organization to access official NYC government info, public event schedules,
    and to hold public discussions about issues in their communities. Coming next:
    email & SMS alerts for committee hearings and council meetings, including agendas
    and minutes.'
  impact: "Councilmatic is currently up in three cities: Chicago, New York City, and
    Philadelphia. Councilmatic is an independent public resource, displaying information
    in the Open Civic Data open standard. The project has unique areas of impact,
    as follows:\n\n- First, it creates new open data on everything in city councils:
    elected officials, committees, public events, and every single legislative item
    - all the bills in city councils - with every action and full text and more.\n-
    A fast, user-focused, mobile-responsive web app\n- Advanced search features to
    filter keyword searches by type of legislation, sponsor, or more\n- Tracking features
    to follow legislative actions over RSS - and coming soon, email and SMS and social
    media\n- Public comment forums (optional) on legislative items, for online discussion
    of local issues\n- SMS outreach (optional) for wider public discussion of community
    priorities\n- “How local government works” help context and legislative process
    explainers\n- Address lookup of local elected officials\n- Maps of geographic
    locations mentioned in bill text\n- Open-data calendar list of upcoming events,
    such as committee hearings or council meetings\n- In Chicago, advanced categorization
    of bills by sub-topic using data analysis of bill text language\n- Filtering options
    to see not just what bills are introduced or recently active, but which were left
    in committee - a meaningful, unique view on introduced legislation that hasn’t
    advanced past committee stages. Useful for journalists and researchers.\n- Forthcoming,
    free embeddable HTML & Javascript widgets for city elected officials, committees
    and any legislative item, for digital media companies\n- In NYC, a free, volunteer
    public dialogue program with “verified” council offices - monthly discussions
    with participating council office staff, to respond online to public comments.
    This program is designed, at about one staff per month, to close the feedback
    loop of civic engagement locally and encourage constituents to post their comments
    on Councilmatic in order to share the response with their community.\n    "

  background: In 2010, Manuel Aristaran launched Gasto Publico Bahiense (gastopublicobahiense.org),
    a site that made it easier to visualize the checkbook entries published by the
    government of Bahia Blanca, Argentina. That impact of the initiative led to a
    collaboration with the government, that resulted in the sponsorship of SpendView.
  shortDescription: Budgeting and expenditure data is the quantitative expression
    of a government’s priorities. Making it available to the public imposes hard challenges
    that not every administration is ready to undertake. The lack of IT capabilities
    and constrained resources of government agencies make it difficult for them to
    respond to the demands of information from their constituencies, transparency
    advocates, the press and central governments. Moreover, these administrations
    don’t usually have access to analysis tools that help them view how the resources
    are being used and to detect potential risks of misspending. SpendView is a platform
    for analysis and visualization of government budget, expenditure and revenue data.
  impact: We are currently working with other municipal, provincial and federal in
    Latin America, helping them to adopt SpendView for internal use, or as a tool
    for fiscal transparency. Using open data, we built instances of Presupuesto Abierto/Spend
    View for the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina (http://caba.presupuestoabierto.org)

  background: Since 2008, Europe has faced its deepest economic and political crisis
    since Second World War. In this context, new social movements and political parties
    are emerging, particularly in Southern European democracies. Podemos, a new Spanish
    political party born from grassroots activism and protests (Indignados Movement),
    is trying to reinvigorate public institutions that have lost the trust of the
    public introducing massive online direct democracy participation mechanisms where
    Spanish citizens can deliberate, make and vote proposals, ask questions of Podemos
    leaders, and even propose and built projects for which to use party money. The
    citizen’s response to this political initiative is being overwhelming.
  shortDescription: This project seeks to analyze how digital tools can be used to
    implement a more direct and participatory democracy. We will be thinking about
    what makes a digital participation process fair and effective, when can digital
    participation be used to make binding decisions, when is it better used to seek
    input, and how can its use be improved. To accomplish that, we will discuss the
    structure and functioning of Podemos' participation tools to promote crowdsourcing,
    crowdvoting and crowdfunding initiatives, the thinking behind each of them, and
    the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. We will then present 'best practices'
    based on these observations.
  impact: Using Podemos as a case study, this project is theoretically and socially
    relevant because it aims to analyze how new technologies can better serve to democratic
    regeneration and propose recommendations to help other political parties around
    the world, and across the spectrum, that want to experiment using technology to
    become more democratic. In other words, our hope is that learning from this unique
    contemporary experience of direct democracy, we can help other political parties
    build on what Podemos has done. It is important to highlight that these lessons
    can be also useful for other public and private institutions (profit and non-profit)
    interacting with citizens to provide services of general interest.

  background: When disaster strikes, communication and power infrastructures are lost
    for days or even weeks at a time. During this time, communications remain critical
    in informing decisions on resource allocation, medical attention, and financial
    aid. To this end, LDLN provides off-the-grid, decentralized communications networks
    for disaster relief agencies and medical professionals deployed to the field.
    Even without a power grid, cell signal, or Internet, relief agents enter rich
    field data into our mobile apps that auto-synchronize with LDLN Base Station for
    quick, accurate reporting at headquarters.
  shortDescription: We provide the framework & technology for organizations and individuals
    to instantly communicate rich data without the need for Internet, cell service,
    satellites or phone lines.
  impact: 'While LDLN tech is designed from the ground up around the most severe situation
    (no external power or data services), having any of these available strengthen
    the power of our network and syncing algorithms. For instance, our Base Stations
    can connect to the Internet via Ethernet, or to a generator or car battery via
    MicroUSB adapter. Additionally, we see opportunity to take our network technology
    beyond the scope of disaster relief, including: private communication networks
    for corporations, digital educational curricula distribution, and as a reliable
    grid for hospitals and medical centers.'

    - the Creative Industries master programme at ESPM University, in Rio
  background: The project started as a collaboration between two OEA fellows in Open
    government. Open Journalism connects the tools and techniques of crowdsourcing
    to news making practices. Instead of opening governments, we are open news media
    outlets to include citizens to make the news.
  shortDescription: Our project makes use of crowdsourcing tools to unite journalists
    and citizens in making the news. We use the participative culture of the web to
    aid journalists to seek help of citizens in reporting public issues, and to aid
    motivated citizens to engage in the news agenda. We capacitative, challenge and
    motivate journalists, citizens and hackers to work together, constructively, in
    news making processes.
  impact: News industries are shrinking. Social media is booming. When we create participatory
    ways to not only consume, but to make the news, we can recreate how news industries
    are funded, and we can also highlight their role as watchdog, civic institutions.
    More news made based on open journalism culture means more citizens connected
    to the news, stronger civil society institutions, and new journalistic posts.

  background: New public policy is made every day by local, national and international
    government institutions. Although governments operate in different contexts across
    the world, they nonetheless face very similar governance challenges--for example,
    educating their populations or increasing their public’s safety. Due to this significant
    overlap in governmental missions, tremendous potential exists for societies to
    pool together their collective knowledge and learn from each other’s successes
    and failures.
  shortDescription: PolicyAtlas is a growing, non-­partisan project to develop a user-contributed
    encyclopedia of known public policy solutions (the “Atlas”). The Atlas will cover
    all major policy fields such as education, environmental, health, and transportation
    policy. For example, when a local government official seeks to reduce pedestrian
    deaths from automobile accidents, they can search the Atlas for policies that
    aim to achieve this goal and be presented with options such as traffic calming
    devices, pedestrian bridges and complete street designations. Dedicated articles
    cover each featured policy concept with a summary of its goals, implementation
    considerations, research studies, and supporters and opponents.
  impact: Ultimately, the goal of PolicyAtlas is to improve the quality of public
    policymaking--and the lives of all who are governed--by providing more public
    policy options, informing better choices among public policies, and improving
    the design of policies in order to increase their likely political viability and
    effectiveness. PolicyAtlas is to become the most useful public policy resource
    in the world. Specific types of people who should find the Atlas useful include
    government officials, election candidates, journalists, advocates and researchers.

    success in Pittsburgh required fixing the basics.
  shortDescription: Our apps, Beacon, Scout, and Conductor, have replaced and augmented
    government purchasing workflows in Pittsburgh. Connected by an open database,
    these tools enable city staff to transparently and efficiently manage, track,
    and advertise contract opportunities.
  impact: Since launching, 500+ businesses have signed up for announcements of contracting
    opportunities with Beacon, 27 City staff are subscribed for contract updates with
    Scout, and the procurement team tracks contracts daily with Conductor.

  background: In our digital age the pressing question is no longer what information
    should be digitized, but rather how this process of digitalization should take
    place. Most public information is currently organized by procedure; publisher’s
    name, due date, etc. However, the content - affected areas or people, topics,
    participants and more - remain largely unstructured. As a result, despite growing
    computational power, machines remain surprisingly incapable of giving us an answer
    to the seemingly simple question; what is going on in my community?
  shortDescription: Commune offers municipal bodies a digital framework - ‘opn’ -
    to create, publish and archive public records as well structured open data, while
    simultaneously increasing their work efficiency and performance.
  impact: Municipality staffers will save time handling public information - local
    business and residents will gain better insight to government decision making
    processes and actions.

  background: Civic Hacking is an agile approach that is focused more on solutions
    than taking a step away and think a lot. The scientific method is what has moved
    science so far to build robust explanations and solutions to so many different
    fields. How can we take the best of the two worlds and build robust explanations
    and solutions to so many different fields. How can we take the best of the worlds
    and build robust solutions while keeping a fast pace?
  shortDescription: 'We try to get the best of the scientific method by following
    a 5 point rulebook to our civic hacking projects, that come from the traditional
    academic research: (1) Clear problem definition (2) Definition of Roles (3) Mentoring
    (4) Follow Up (5) Publish and Share'
  impact: Every project in our brigade needs to have great reach and impact. Taking
    into account past efforts, building bridges to experienced community and having
    a philosophy of sharing and publishing, will help build more solid projects.
