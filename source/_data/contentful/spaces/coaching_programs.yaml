  shortDescription: Led by New York City Council member Ben Kallos, this program is
    designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs who are developing
    projects around the automation and delivery of benefits and services for citizens.
  longDescription: |-
    For many low-income citizens, getting access to benefits for which they are already eligible requires them to negotiate a minefield of forms, websites and duplicate documentation. Technology can improve government and organizational efficiency and ensure that thousands of citizens don’t lose out on benefits simply by enabling the automation of enrollment and renewal of people into the system. Recertifications can be automatic rather than arduous, eliminating repetitive paperwork and allowing people to get what they need and the government to reduce administrative costs.

    Innovations in Automatic Benefits for Citizens is a ten week online coaching program designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs (both individuals and teams) who are developing projects around the automation and delivery of benefits and services for citizens. With expert guidance from Councilmember Ben Kallos, Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations of the New York City Council, we will help you to understand the operational flow of government as well as how to start building free and open source tools and/or bridge them with resources like OpenFisca and CiviCRM.

    Whether your project is nonprofit or for-profit, this program aims, through peer-to-peer support and expert coaching and mentoring, to help innovators design, implement, scale, and assess effective projects.
  courseFormat: 1 faculty-led session every other week for 2 hours (one hour is with
    a guest expert and one hour is an all-group session); and a personalized schedule
    of peer-to-peer and one-on-one coaching sessions.

  shortDescription: Bringing innovation to the government supply chain is about promising
    and delivering on greater productivity and improved workflows.
  longDescription: "Today we have a misalignment between our citizens’ expectations
    that government will solve problems effectively and fast and how public procurement
    is practiced. Government should not be spending as much to make a website as it
    invests in scientific research to map the human brain. Contracts should not get
    awarded to the same enterprise over and over again but attract more and more diverse
    competitors.\n\nBut bringing innovation to the government supply chain is also
    about meeting the needs of citizens more effectively by accepting that in government
    we should excel of defining the problems and allow the market to inspire us about
    the different approaches to solving them. This can also be about data-informed
    decision support, new evaluation frameworks and more representative selection
    panels.\n\nIdeal participants are those who have already identified a project
    and/or have a project underway and have clear insight into the problem they are
    trying to address. This course is designed for those focusing on all stages and
    types of contracting reform, bureaucracy and problem-solving at all levels of
    government, including projects that: make procurement better at solving problems;
    lower the entry barrier to participation; attract more diverse, minority and women-owned
    businesses; enable more open review and decision-making processes; encourage the
    procurement of innovative solutions; decrease corruption and improve accountability.
    If you are engaged in an effort to bring greater sanity to the procurement process
    come join us! \n\nThe GovLab Academy coaching programs have helped 450 government,
    social and civic entrepreneurs take 250 projects from idea to implementation.
    \ We aim to help you “cross the chasm” from idea to implementation and help you
    scale."

  shortDescription: Coaching program designed by Citizen Cyberlab, The GovLab , Nestlé
    and the Alliance4YOUTH partners, to help the participants of the “Alliance4Youth
    Challenge 2016” prepare to pitch their ideas of “The most attractive company in
    2020.
  longDescription: "At an historic UN summit in September 2015, world leaders formally
    committed to the set of 17 “sustainable development goals” that form the heart
    of the UN’s ambitious 2030 Agenda. The 8th of these goals calls for the promotion
    of inclusive and sustainable economic development, full and productive employment,
    and decent work for all. Everyone understands that achieving these noble outcomes
    will, inevitably, require meaningful changes in public policy. But it will also
    require deep changes in what private sector institutions do and, every bit as
    important, in the ways they organize themselves to do it.\n\nWhen individuals
    at work feel unheard, unseen, and undervalued, their daily experience on the job
    alienates instead of engages. When they feel unable to make real contributions
    because the levers for doing so lie well out of reach, fat paychecks flowing to
    the accounts of distant barons offer neither satisfaction nor incentive, but only
    fuel for discontent and anger. This has always been true. For the millennials
    now and soon to be in the workforce, the truth goes deeper still. Their expectations
    are higher, their skills greater, and their patience lower than those of the generations
    before them. They are poised to contribute and have much to contribute. If their
    work offers them no effective means to do so, they will be frustrated and all
    of society will be the poorer – and the more fragile.\n\nIn practice, this means
    that corporate MANAGERS will need to find new and compelling ways in which to
    tap, harness, and leverage the knowledge, skills, energy, and commitment of theIR
    millennial COLLEAGUES. Companies, positions, and work assignments must do more
    than just organize and support them. They must energize and engage them. Indeed,
    every plausible road to SDG 8 passes through the gate of engagement. \n\nAccordingly,
    Citizen Cyberlab, The GovLab , Nestlé and the Alliance4YOUTH partners are sponsoring
    a challenge for up to 80 students from across Swiss universities. Teams of no
    more than 5 or 6 from across universities will each choose a sector within which
    to focus and, then, devise an integrated plan for how a company operating in that
    sector can best use available tools, diagnostic frameworks, information and social
    technologies, and managerial approaches to engage and energize their people.\n\nEvery
    week for 5 weeks, beginning October 2016, all teams will have access to a 2 hour,
    on-line expert coaching session, which is designed to support them in framing
    the challenge as they think best, managing team process and dynamics, becoming
    familiar with relevant information and social technologies, and putting together
    and rehearsing their final “pitch” – a 10 minute-per-team presentation, followed
    by 5 minutes of Q&A – for delivery on 23 November at Nestle in Geneva to a judging
    panel including A4Y members and a UN representative. Prizes will be given for
    the best overall pitch and the best presentation."
  courseFormat: 1 faculty-led session every week for 2 hours with presentations from
    representatives of partner organizations and feedback from the coaches for each
    team’s presentation on the topic of the week leading up to one “final” pitch at
    Nestle in Geneva to a judging panel including A4Y members and a UN representative.

  shortDescription: This program is a first-of-its-kind online convening of those
    working on empirically-based criminal justice innovation projects, including those
    working in criminal justice, health, mental health and related agencies as well
    as researchers and advocates
  longDescription: |
    Coaching Program for Data Driven Criminal Justice Projects has support from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and is run in partnership with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (and its efforts to accelerate more city, county and states willing to adopt voluntary, data-driven approaches to improve public health and safety, and reduce unnecessary incarceration). The program is a first-of-its-kind online convening of those working on empirically-based criminal justice innovation projects, including those working in criminal justice, health, mental health and related agencies as well as researchers and advocates, and who share a common desire to make greater use of data to understand past performance, improve day-to-day operations, and develop innovative approaches to the operations of the criminal justice system.

    Perhaps you want to combine arrest data with Medicaid hospitalization data to identify the super-utilizers of both systems? Or you are stuck trying to figure out the applicable legal and privacy protections inhibiting the creation of data exchanges? Maybe you want to identify which social service alternatives to incarceration are working, when and for whom, and which are not? Have you developed a new algorithm for determining pre-trial release?

    Every other week for ten weeks, participants will come together to learn both from one another and from experts in responsible data sharing practices. Participants also receive personalized project management coaching designed to help you overcome the specific barriers to implementation you are facing.

    This program is offered in response to what we are hearing from you about the demand for more help, expertise and capacity building to enable you to make better use of data both to understand past performance and to improve day-to-day operations of criminal justice in your communities.

    The program is intended for those with a data driven criminal justice innovation project in mind. It is not a lecture course in data science but a hands-on, customized coaching and mentoring program for up to 12 teams or individuals. The program is designed to help you bring your project from idea to fruition. The program follows the outlines of our public problem solving method but is flexibly configured to be responsive to your specific needs.

    With implementation as our lodestar, we will focus together on developing the essential aspects of the projects at each stage.
  courseFormat: 1 faculty-led session every other week for 2 hours (one hour is with
    a guest expert and one hour is an all-group session); and a personalized schedule
    of peer-to-peer and one-on-one coaching sessions.
  moreInformation: "- If accepted, participants are asked to complete a questionnaire
    about their projects to aid with up-front diagnosis of challenges and the design
    of a customized support curriculum. \n\n- Thanks to a generous grant from the
    Arnold Foundation, the program is free of charge to participants. However, participants
    are expected to commit to the duration of the program."

  longDescription: |-
    Innovations in Disaster Management is a ten week online coaching program designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs (both individuals and teams) who are developing projects that have the potential to tackle the pressing needs of people in disaster-affected communities. Whether your project is nonprofit or for-profit and whether you are focusing on disaster preparedness, disaster management or disaster relief, this program aims, through peer-to-peer support and expert coaching and mentoring, to help humanitarian innovators implement, scale, and assess effective projects.

    Ideal participants are those who have already identified a project and/or have a project underway and have clear insight into the problem they are trying to ameliorate. Projects might aim to tackle diverse issues from the protection of vulnerable populations, to strengthening health initiatives, to providing shelter, education, and livelihood opportunities. They will have in common the application of open, data-driven, bottom-up and collaborative approaches. A public interest and public engagement focus should ultimately be the driving force behind the projects.

    The GovLab Academy coaching programs have helped 450 government, social and civic entrepreneurs take 250 projects from idea to implementation. We aim to help you “cross the chasm” from idea to implementation and help you scale.
  courseFormat: 1 faculty-led session every other week for 2 hours (one hour is with
    a guest expert and one hour is an all-group session); and a personalized schedule
    of peer-to-peer and one-on-one coaching sessions.
  moreInformation: "- Fee: $250 per project. Each project can have a team of up to
    5 participants.\n\n- The $250 fee helps to cover the stipend that we offer to
    coaches to compensate them for their time. We hope to offer financial aid scholarships
    to help international teams that would otherwise not be able to participate in
    the coaching program due to financial constraints. If your team would like to
    be considered for a scholarship (should your project be selected), please check
