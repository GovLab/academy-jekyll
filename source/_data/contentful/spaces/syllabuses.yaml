  description: 'More and more organizations are turning to crowds for help in solving
    their most vexing innovation and research questions. But managers remain understandably
    cautious. It seems risky and even unnatural to push problems out to vast groups
    of strangers distributed around the world, particularly for organizations and
    institutions built on a history of internal innovation. Understanding what kinds
    of problems a crowd really can handle better and how to manage the process requires
    careful design. However, after a decade of study, we have identified when crowds
    tend to outperform internal organizations (or not). This program is designed to
    help those wishing to integrate crowdsourcing into ongoing projects. Whether policymaking
    or service delivery in nature, we start from the assumption that, engaging citizens
    is generally both more effective and more legitimate as a way of working. Together
    we will explore how to better harness crowdsourcing and distributed innovation
    networks by offering guidance on choosing the best form of crowdsourcing for a
    given situation. '

  syllabusTitle: Solving Public Problems With Data
  description: "__Introduction to Why Data Matters? Why Data Science Matters? __ \n*Led
    by Ben Wellington*\n\nExamples and stories of how can data and data science help
    solve Public Problems.\n\n__Introduction to Evidence-Based Decision-Making: Examples
    in Economic Development__\n*Led by Quentin Palfrey*\n\nIf you invest in things
    that do not work rather than those that do, real people’s lives may be affected
    in dramatic ways. However, how do you know what works? Through real-world examples
    and contemporary debates (e.g., the expansion of health insurance, or  crime and
    violence prevention), you will understand the basic principles of evidence-based
    decision making, how this relates to “counterfactual” reasoning, and frameworks
    for thinking about how to apply rigorous, scientifically-based methods to solve
    problems in ways that are  both effective and cost-effective. \n\n__Read:__\n“Introduction
    to Evaluations” by JPAL - an overarching summary of “impact evaluations”, their
    history, how to randomize effectively in experiments, why randomization is important,
    and common concerns in study design\n“Promoting Policies that work: Six steps
    for the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking” by Quentin Palfrey - a list
    of six concrete steps policymakers “can take to institutionalize the use of administrative
    data to support policy-relevant research and evidence-informed policymaking.”\n“Incentives
    for Immunization” by JPAL - a write-up of a study referenced in Quentin’s lecture,
    on how using costly incentives in an evaluation may actually decrease the marginal
    cost of participation in a social program.\n\n__Watch:__\nWatch “Social experiments
    to fight poverty” by Esther Duflo, Professor of Economics at MIT, explain in further
    detail why social experiments may help policymakers with poverty alleviation,
    and why experimental designs provide compelling and unforeseen insights where
    other study approaches may fail.\n\n__How-To:__\nUtilize the Methods Guides an
    online experimental Tools written by Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP).
    These guides provide both technical and non-technical discussions on challenges
    commonly faced in causal inference, why randomization is important to experimental
    design and causal attribution, but also cases when of non-experimental designs
    may lead to causal insights. Example code, written in the R programming language,
    is accessible here online, as well as example vignettes.\n\n__Data Analytical
    Thinking and Methods I: How To Define a Research Question and Introduction to
    Statistical Approaches to Draw Inference__\n*Led by Julia Lane*\n\nDuring this
    session you will learn about quantitative data—including so-called “big data”—
    and some of the statistical techniques researchers and policy officials  use  to
    derive value from it. The lecture emphasizes  the broad structure and necessary
    steps  needed in any data-related inquiry: define a research question, formulate
    a testable hypothesis,  think about what data is available, what data is missing,
    issues of measurement error, and other applied concerns, such as how to  link
    datasets. At the end, we will discuss some of the statistical paradigms  that
    can be used to draw inferences, as well as some of the key ideas when addressing
    the privacy and confidentiality issues. \n\n__Read:__\nBig Data and Social Science:
    A Practical Guide to Methods and Tools by Ian Foster, Rayid Ghani, Ron S. Jarmin,
    Frauke Kreuter, and Julia Lane\n__How-To:__\nFor an in-depth training, check out
    the Applied Data Analytics Training Program, the first-of-its-kind program to
    give working professionals an opportunity to develop the key computer science
    and data science skill sets necessary to harness the wealth of newly-available
    data and to creatively address real civic problems.\n\n__Machine Learning Applications
    for the Public Sector__\n*Led by Gideon Mann*\n\nOftentimes a business or organization
    may wish to do the same task over and over again, and there is a lot of data at
    its disposal. In such settings, machine learning algorithms may be a useful way
    forward to help solve many problems that would be too burdensome for humans to
    do each time by hand. The lecture discusses differences between prediction systems
    and recommendation tasks, supplemented by examples from industry that include
    e-commerce applications, language modeling, and image analysis. The lecture discusses
    challenges machine learning algorithms face when the underlying data collected
    are “biased” or not representative of your target population or problem.\n\n__Read:__\nA
    visual introduction to machine learning by R2D3 - machine learning explained in
    interactive visualizations.\nAn executive’s guide to machine learning by McKinsey
    - read how are traditional industries using machine learning to gather fresh business
    insights?\nAutomation Beyond the Physical: AI in the Public Sector by Government
    Technology - 26 ways artificial intelligence is, or could, help government do
    its job.\n\n__Discovering and Collecting Data: Practical Advice for Government
    Managers__\n*Led by Carter Hewgley *\n\nThis session will focus on strategies
    for identifying, finding and getting data: where to locate information; when and
    how you can collect your own data internally and externally (e.g. through FOIA
    requests or crowdsourcing) as well as techniques to verify and validate your data
    sources. We also discuss questions of data quality and how to identify what skills
    you need to have access to in order to make use of the data you need. \n\n__Read:__\nData
    for Development: The Case for Information, Not Just Data by Daniela Ligiero -
    an article that explores the importance of not only having more and better data,
    but also the need to make better use of the data we already have, transforming
    it into useful information to guide action for the betterment of people and planet.\nInnovations
    in Federal Statistics: Combining Data Sources While Protecting Privacy by the
    National Academies of Sciences’s Panel on Improving Federal Statistics for Policy
    and Social Science - a report that examines the opportunities and risks of using
    government administrative and private sector data sources to foster a paradigm
    shift in federal statistical programs that would combine diverse data sources
    in a secure manner to enhance federal statistics.\n\n__Platforms and Where to
    Store the Data?__\n*Led by Arnaud Sahuguet *\n\nIn this session, we discuss the
    state of the art in technologies for collecting, storing, analyzing and visualizing
    data. In particular, we focus on four hypothetical applications for each topic
    in order that you understand what’s possible and what options are available for
    you to be able to perform each activity. \n\n__Read: __\nOpen Data Resource Kit
    by Jun Matsushita and Arnaud Sahuguet - Everything you ever wanted to know when
    starting your open data project… but were too afraid to ask.\n\n\n__Data Analytical
    Thinking and Methods II: Correlation, Causation and Decision-Making__\n*Led by
    Daniel L. Goroff*\n\nThis lecture discusses common inferential challenges and
    risks people face when working with data, including: thinking about conditional
    probability, the distinction between association (or correlation) and causation,
    what it means for events to be “independent,” and how to claim a result is “statistically
    significant” is related to an implicit theory of randomness. The lecture closes
    by giving some practical advice about how to think through these concepts in your
    own domain.\n\n__Barriers to Building a Data Practice in Government__\n*Led by
    Beth Blauer*\n\nDuring this session we will discuss the risks of collecting and
    using data in government  including financial costs, lack of institutional readiness,
    lack of skills and available talent, lack of a governance framework, ethical concerns
    including privacy, security, confidentiality, and questions of how to share data
    between organizations and with researchers. We discuss strategies for overcoming
    these risks. \n\n__Read:__\nSelected Readings on Data Governance by The GovLab
    - an annotated and curated collection of recommended works on Data Governance.\n\n__Data
    Collaboratives and Corporate Data Philanthropy__\n*Led by Stefaan Verhulst*\n\nMuch
    of the data that would be valuable to access and analyze resides with the private
    sector—in the form of, for instance, Web clicks, online purchases, sensor data,
    and call data records. With consumers connected to more and more platforms as
    well as the increasing prevalence of sensing technologies (i.e. the Internet of
    Things), data on how people and societies behave is becoming even more privately
    owned. In this session, we discuss private sources of data to solve public problems
    and best practices for how data can be shared between private and public organizations.
