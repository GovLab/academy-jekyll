  description: 'More and more organizations are turning to crowds for help in solving
    their most vexing innovation and research questions. But managers remain understandably
    cautious. It seems risky and even unnatural to push problems out to vast groups
    of strangers distributed around the world, particularly for organizations and
    institutions built on a history of internal innovation. Understanding what kinds
    of problems a crowd really can handle better and how to manage the process requires
    careful design. However, after a decade of study, we have identified when crowds
    tend to outperform internal organizations (or not). This program is designed to
    help those wishing to integrate crowdsourcing into ongoing projects. Whether policymaking
    or service delivery in nature, we start from the assumption that, engaging citizens
    is generally both more effective and more legitimate as a way of working. Together
    we will explore how to better harness crowdsourcing and distributed innovation
    networks by offering guidance on choosing the best form of crowdsourcing for a
    given situation. '
