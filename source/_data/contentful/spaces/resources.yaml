  shortDescription: Smart cities are associated almost exclusively with modern technology
    and infrastructure. However, smart cities have the possibility to enhance the
    involvement and contribution of citizens to urban development. This work explores
    the role of governance as one of the factors influencing the participation of
    citizens in smart cities projects. Governance characteristics play a major role
    in explaining different typologies of citizen participation.

  shortDescription: 'Billions of dollars have been spent on participatory development
    programs in the developing world. These programs give community members an active
    decision-making role. Given the emphasis on community involvement, one might expect
    that the effectiveness of this approach would depend on communities'' pre-existing
    social capital stocks.  '

    ‘markets’, ‘networks’ and ‘persuasion’. In this article, it is argued that ‘nudging’

  shortDescription: Public sector agencies routinely store large volumes of information
    about individuals in the community. The storage and analysis of this information
    benefits society, as it enables relevant agencies to make better informed decisions
    and to address the individual's needs more appropriately. Members of the public
    often assume that the authorities are well equipped to handle personal data; however,
    due to implementation errors and lack of data governance, this is not always the
    case.

  shortDescription: 'In Reinventing Discovery, Michael Nielsen argues that we are
    living at the dawn of the most dramatic change in science in more than 300 years.
    This change is being driven by powerful new cognitive tools, enabled by the internet,
    which are greatly accelerating scientific discovery. There are many books about
    how the internet is changing business or the workplace or government. '
