  longBio: "Francois Grey is a physicist by training, with a background in nanotechnology
    and a passion for citizen science. Since September 2014, he is Invited Professor
    at the University of Geneva and Manager of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre, a
    partnership between CERN, the United Nations Institute of Training and Research
    and the University of Geneva. \n\nThe CCC develops technologies that lower the
    barrier to entry for online participatory science and promotes the use of these
    technologies in developing regions through face-to-face meetups between scientists,
    developers and citizens. The CCC has helped to launch citizen science projects
    such as CERN’s Test4Theory, which is part of the LHC@home volunteer computing
    initiative, and open source platforms for citizen science like Crowdcrafting.org,
    for volunteer thinking. Events launched by the CCC include the Africa@Home, Asia@home
    and Brasil@home workshops series, the CERN Webfest and the biannual Citizen Cyberscience
    Summit. \n\nFrom 2013-2014 Francois was Head of Citizen Science at NYU’s Center
    for Urban Science and Progress, where he launched the Science and the City hackathons
    in collaboration with ITP, NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program and Science
    Hack Day NYC in collaboration with the World Science Festival. \n\nFrancois was
    based in Beijing from 2008-2013, where he helped establish the Open Wisdom Lab
    at Tsinghua University, China’s MIT, to promote concepts of open and participatory
    science. He also helped establish Tsinghua’s Lifelong Learning Lab, which extends
    concepts of participatory science to children of all ages. He has also been a
    visiting Senior International Expert with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where
    he initiated online citizen science in China through a project called CAS@home.
    Francois received a prestigious Fellowship from the South-Africa-based Shuttleworth
    Foundation in 2010-11, for his efforts to promote citizen science in the developing
    world."

With a grant from Markets for Good, he is collaborating with New Philanthropy Capital in the UK to craft a series of case studies about Data Labs and explore how they can enable charities as well as government to conduct more data-driven impact evaluations.

    Last year, Anirudh helped to research, write and produce ten original Smarter State case studies, focusing on how governments can use technology to leverage the skills of civil servants. He has also researched and authored reports on Open Data for Developing Economies, a project to explore the social and economic impact of opening government data.

He has coordinated multiple online classes and coaching programs for the GovLab Academy, including the ones on innovations in tech-enabled disaster management and data driven criminal justice.

  longBio: 'Ms Rosy Mondardini, managing director of the ETH/UZH Citizen Science Center,
    focused her intervention on the data generated by citizens and how this kind of
    data can play a role for the SDGs. She explained that citizen science describes
    the collaboration between citizens and scientists on scientific research. Traditionally,
    scientists define the project, citizens are involved in data collection, and scientists
    then do the data analysis. However, now citizens are more and more involved in
    the data analysis and throughout the overall  process. She gave examples of citizen
    science from the areas of biology and physics, such as involving citizens in checking
    water quality and classifying galaxies. Mondardini then gave examples of three
    projects that put citizens ‘at the heart of the activity and the data collection’
    in the area of development: safecast (link is external) which saw citizens monitor
    radiation levels after the 2011 earthquake and Fukushima accident in Japan; foldit
    (link is external) an online puzzle video game about protein folding; and hot
    (link is external), a humanitarian open street map team which engaged volunteers
    in checking satellite images to identify damages to buildings and other infrastructure
    in the aftermath of major disasters. Mondardini argued that projects like these
    fill gaps in science and provide substance to make informed decisions to support
    development and monitoring as part of the SDGs
