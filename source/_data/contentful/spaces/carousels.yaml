    facultyTitle: Co-founder & Director of Community Development at the Public Lab
    longBio: 'Liz is an activist and designer interested in collaborative urban environments.
      My early days in New York involved catalyzing public interactions on sidewalks
      and subway stations with a giant "Talk To Me" sign as well as working 25 floors
      above Wall Street (SOM) designing international new cities and campuses. I''m
      originally from North Carolina where I managed an urban agriculture youth enterprise
      called the Durham Inner-city Gardeners (DIG). Currently, when I''m not hoisting
      cameras up on balloons (with Public Laboratory) or hugging trees with tape measures
      (with TreeKIT), I teach geospatial tools for urban design at Columbia, Parsons,
      and Pratt. '
