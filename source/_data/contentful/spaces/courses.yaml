  shortDescription: The explosion in the availability of new sources of data and the
    emergence of new data science technologies for making use of such data are expected
    to have a significant impact on public institutions and how they solve problems
    and make decisions. Whether the goal is improved outcomes and equities, reduced
    cost and inefficiency, more evidence about what works or the identification of
    new operational solutions, the ability to use data is becoming essential to governing
    well in the 21st century.
  longDescription: "“Solving Public Problems with Data” examines how data can be used
    to improve decisionmaking and problem solving in the public sector. Through real
    world examples and case studies, we discuss the fundamental principles of data
    science to help foster a data analytic mindset. The goal is to enable you to define
    and leverage the value of data to achieve your public mission. No prior experience
    with computer science or statistics is necessary or assumed.\n\n“The world’s national,
    state and local governments don’t have the right digital skills in the right quantities
    to meet the challenges of the coming century,” declared mySociety Founder Tom
    Steinberg in his Manifesto for Public Technology. With “Solving Public Problems
    with Data” public entrepreneurs have a chance to make up lost ground. This and
    other data primers and lecture series can also spark movement. We can lament the
    dearth of data scientists in government, or refocus our efforts on arming public
    entrepreneurs with tools they need to build a data-driven public sector. \n"

    syllabusTitle: Solving Public Problems With Data
    description: "__Introduction to Why Data Matters? Why Data Science Matters?__
      \n*Led by Ben Wellington*\n\nExamples and stories of how can data and data science
      help solve Public Problems.\n\n__Introduction to Evidence-Based Decision-Making:
      Examples in Economic Development__\n*Led by Quentin Palfrey*\n\nIf you invest
      in things that do not work rather than those that do, real people’s lives may
      be affected in dramatic ways. However, how do you know what works? Through real-world
      examples and contemporary debates (e.g., the expansion of health insurance,
      or  crime and violence prevention), you will understand the basic principles
      of evidence-based decision making, how this relates to “counterfactual” reasoning,
      and frameworks for thinking about how to apply rigorous, scientifically-based
      methods to solve problems in ways that are  both effective and cost-effective.
      \n\n__Read:__\n“Introduction to Evaluations” by JPAL - an overarching summary
      of “impact evaluations”, their history, how to randomize effectively in experiments,
      why randomization is important, and common concerns in study design\n“Promoting
      Policies that work: Six steps for the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking”
      by Quentin Palfrey - a list of six concrete steps policymakers “can take to
      institutionalize the use of administrative data to support policy-relevant research
      and evidence-informed policymaking.”\n“Incentives for Immunization” by JPAL
      - a write-up of a study referenced in Quentin’s lecture, on how using costly
      incentives in an evaluation may actually decrease the marginal cost of participation
      in a social program.\n\n__Watch:__\nWatch “Social experiments to fight poverty”
      by Esther Duflo, Professor of Economics at MIT, explain in further detail why
      social experiments may help policymakers with poverty alleviation, and why experimental
      designs provide compelling and unforeseen insights where other study approaches
      may fail.\n\n__How-To:__\nUtilize the Methods Guides an online experimental
      Tools written by Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP). These guides provide
      both technical and non-technical discussions on challenges commonly faced in
      causal inference, why randomization is important to experimental design and
      causal attribution, but also cases when of non-experimental designs may lead
      to causal insights. Example code, written in the R programming language, is
      accessible here online, as well as example vignettes.\n\n__Data Analytical Thinking
      and Methods I: How To Define a Research Question and Introduction to Statistical
      Approaches to Draw Inference__\n*Led by Julia Lane*\n\nDuring this session you
      will learn about quantitative data—including so-called “big data”— and some
      of the statistical techniques researchers and policy officials  use  to derive
      value from it. The lecture emphasizes  the broad structure and necessary steps
      \ needed in any data-related inquiry: define a research question, formulate
      a testable hypothesis,  think about what data is available, what data is missing,
      issues of measurement error, and other applied concerns, such as how to  link
      datasets. At the end, we will discuss some of the statistical paradigms  that
      can be used to draw inferences, as well as some of the key ideas when addressing
      the privacy and confidentiality issues. \n\n__Read:__\nBig Data and Social Science:
      A Practical Guide to Methods and Tools by Ian Foster, Rayid Ghani, Ron S. Jarmin,
      Frauke Kreuter, and Julia Lane\n__How-To:__\nFor an in-depth training, check

      to give working professionals an opportunity to develop the key computer science
      and data science skill sets necessary to harness the wealth of newly-available
      data and to creatively address real civic problems.\n\n__Machine Learning Applications
      for the Public Sector__\n*Led by Gideon Mann*\n\nOftentimes a business or organization
      may wish to do the same task over and over again, and there is a lot of data
      at its disposal. In such settings, machine learning algorithms may be a useful
      way forward to help solve many problems that would be too burdensome for humans
      to do each time by hand. The lecture discusses differences between prediction
      systems and recommendation tasks, supplemented by examples from industry that
      include e-commerce applications, language modeling, and image analysis. The
      lecture discusses challenges machine learning algorithms face when the underlying
      data collected are “biased” or not representative of your target population
      or problem.\n\n__Read:__\nA visual introduction to machine learning by R2D3

      intelligence is, or could, help government do its job.\n\n__Discovering and
      Collecting Data: Practical Advice for Government Managers__\n*Led by Carter
      Hewgley*\n\nThis session will focus on strategies for identifying, finding and
      getting data: where to locate information; when and how you can collect your
      own data internally and externally (e.g. through FOIA requests or crowdsourcing)
      as well as techniques to verify and validate your data sources. We also discuss
      questions of data quality and how to identify what skills you need to have access
      to in order to make use of the data you need. \n\n__Read:__\nData for Development:
      The Case for Information, Not Just Data by Daniela Ligiero - an article that
      explores the importance of not only having more and better data, but also the

      government administrative and private sector data sources to foster a paradigm
      shift in federal statistical programs that would combine diverse data sources
      in a secure manner to enhance federal statistics.\n\n__Platforms and Where to
      Store the Data?__\n*Led by Arnaud Sahuguet*\n\nIn this session, we discuss the
      state of the art in technologies for collecting, storing, analyzing and visualizing
      data. In particular, we focus on four hypothetical applications for each topic
      in order that you understand what’s possible and what options are available

      Analytical Thinking and Methods II: Correlation, Causation and Decision-Making__\n*Led
      by Daniel L. Goroff*\n\nThis lecture discusses common inferential challenges
      and risks people face when working with data, including: thinking about conditional
      probability, the distinction between association (or correlation) and causation,
      what it means for events to be “independent,” and how to claim a result is “statistically
      significant” is related to an implicit theory of randomness. The lecture closes
      by giving some practical advice about how to think through these concepts in
      your own domain.\n\n__Barriers to Building a Data Practice in Government__\n*Led
      by Beth Blauer*\n\nDuring this session we will discuss the risks of collecting
      and using data in government  including financial costs, lack of institutional
      readiness, lack of skills and available talent, lack of a governance framework,
      ethical concerns including privacy, security, confidentiality, and questions
      of how to share data between organizations and with researchers. We discuss
      strategies for overcoming these risks. \n\n__Read:__\nSelected Readings on Data

      analyze resides with the private sector—in the form of, for instance, Web clicks,
      online purchases, sensor data, and call data records. With consumers connected
      to more and more platforms as well as the increasing prevalence of sensing technologies
      (i.e. the Internet of Things), data on how people and societies behave is becoming
      even more privately owned. In this session, we discuss private sources of data
      to solve public problems and best practices for how data can be shared between
      private and public organizations. \n\n__Read:__ \nData Collaboratives: Exchanging
