  description: At the GovLab, we believe that innovation stems from collaboration
    as complex problems need to be solved with the skills and expertise of many. We
    hope you use the Academy to develop your own innate problem solving abilities
    and as a launching pad for your own bigger and greater work within both the private
    and public sector

    Along with GovLab Academy, weâ€™ve created the Network of Innovators, the first skill sharing online platform that enables our alumni government and civic innovators to asses their problem-solving skills and get matched to those with complementary knowledge for mutual learning.

    The Network of Innovators is premised on the belief that traditional titles and academic credentials do not adequately convey the skills and experiences people have and would willingly share. By promoting the exchange of knowledge about more agile, data-driven, open and collaborative approaches to working, NoI aims to enhance how we govern and solve public problems.
