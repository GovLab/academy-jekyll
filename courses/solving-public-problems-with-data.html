          <h2>Course Description</h2>
          <p>“Solving Public Problems with Data” examines how data can be used to improve decisionmaking and problem solving in the public sector. Through real world examples and case studies, we discuss the fundamental principles of data science to help foster a data analytic mindset. The goal is to enable you to define and leverage the value of data to achieve your public mission. No prior experience with computer science or statistics is necessary or assumed.</p>

<p>“The world’s national, state and local governments don’t have the right digital skills in the right quantities to meet the challenges of the coming century,” declared mySociety Founder Tom Steinberg in his Manifesto for Public Technology. With “Solving Public Problems with Data” public entrepreneurs have a chance to make up lost ground. This and other data primers and lecture series can also spark movement. We can lament the dearth of data scientists in government, or refocus our efforts on arming public entrepreneurs with tools they need to build a data-driven public sector.</p>

<em>Led by Ben Wellington</em></p>

<p>Examples and stories of how can data and data science help solve Public Problems.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Evidence-Based Decision-Making: Examples in Economic Development</strong>
<em>Led by Quentin Palfrey</em></p>

<p>If you invest in things that do not work rather than those that do, real people’s lives may be affected in dramatic ways. However, how do you know what works? Through real-world examples and contemporary debates (e.g., the expansion of health insurance, or  crime and violence prevention), you will understand the basic principles of evidence-based decision making, how this relates to “counterfactual” reasoning, and frameworks for thinking about how to apply rigorous, scientifically-based methods to solve problems in ways that are  both effective and cost-effective.</p>

<p><strong>Read:</strong>
“Introduction to Evaluations” by JPAL - an overarching summary of “impact evaluations”, their history, how to randomize effectively in experiments, why randomization is important, and common concerns in study design
“Promoting Policies that work: Six steps for the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking” by Quentin Palfrey - a list of six concrete steps policymakers “can take to institutionalize the use of administrative data to support policy-relevant research and evidence-informed policymaking.”
“Incentives for Immunization” by JPAL - a write-up of a study referenced in Quentin’s lecture, on how using costly incentives in an evaluation may actually decrease the marginal cost of participation in a social program.</p>

<p><strong>Watch:</strong>
Watch “Social experiments to fight poverty” by Esther Duflo, Professor of Economics at MIT, explain in further detail why social experiments may help policymakers with poverty alleviation, and why experimental designs provide compelling and unforeseen insights where other study approaches may fail.</p>

<p><strong>How-To:</strong>
Utilize the Methods Guides an online experimental Tools written by Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP). These guides provide both technical and non-technical discussions on challenges commonly faced in causal inference, why randomization is important to experimental design and causal attribution, but also cases when of non-experimental designs may lead to causal insights. Example code, written in the R programming language, is accessible here online, as well as example vignettes.</p>

<p><strong>Data Analytical Thinking and Methods I: How To Define a Research Question and Introduction to Statistical Approaches to Draw Inference</strong>
<em>Led by Julia Lane</em></p>

<p>During this session you will learn about quantitative data—including so-called “big data”— and some of the statistical techniques researchers and policy officials  use  to derive value from it. The lecture emphasizes  the broad structure and necessary steps  needed in any data-related inquiry: define a research question, formulate a testable hypothesis,  think about what data is available, what data is missing, issues of measurement error, and other applied concerns, such as how to  link datasets. At the end, we will discuss some of the statistical paradigms  that can be used to draw inferences, as well as some of the key ideas when addressing the privacy and confidentiality issues.</p>

<strong>How-To:</strong>
For an in-depth training, check out the Applied Data Analytics Training Program, the first-of-its-kind program to give working professionals an opportunity to develop the key computer science and data science skill sets necessary to harness the wealth of newly-available data and to creatively address real civic problems.</p>

<p><strong>Machine Learning Applications for the Public Sector</strong>
<em>Led by Gideon Mann</em></p>

<p>Oftentimes a business or organization may wish to do the same task over and over again, and there is a lot of data at its disposal. In such settings, machine learning algorithms may be a useful way forward to help solve many problems that would be too burdensome for humans to do each time by hand. The lecture discusses differences between prediction systems and recommendation tasks, supplemented by examples from industry that include e-commerce applications, language modeling, and image analysis. The lecture discusses challenges machine learning algorithms face when the underlying data collected are “biased” or not representative of your target population or problem.</p>

<p><strong>Discovering and Collecting Data: Practical Advice for Government Managers</strong>
<em>Led by Carter Hewgley</em></p>

<p>This session will focus on strategies for identifying, finding and getting data: where to locate information; when and how you can collect your own data internally and externally (e.g. through FOIA requests or crowdsourcing) as well as techniques to verify and validate your data sources. We also discuss questions of data quality and how to identify what skills you need to have access to in order to make use of the data you need.</p>

<p><strong>Read:</strong>
Data for Development: The Case for Information, Not Just Data by Daniela Ligiero - an article that explores the importance of not only having more and better data, but also the need to make better use of the data we already have, transforming it into useful information to guide action for the betterment of people and planet.

<p><strong>Platforms and Where to Store the Data?</strong>
<em>Led by Arnaud Sahuguet</em></p>

<p>In this session, we discuss the state of the art in technologies for collecting, storing, analyzing and visualizing data. In particular, we focus on four hypothetical applications for each topic in order that you understand what’s possible and what options are available for you to be able to perform each activity.</p>

<p><strong>Data Analytical Thinking and Methods II: Correlation, Causation and Decision-Making</strong>
<em>Led by Daniel L. Goroff</em></p>

<p>This lecture discusses common inferential challenges and risks people face when working with data, including: thinking about conditional probability, the distinction between association (or correlation) and causation, what it means for events to be “independent,” and how to claim a result is “statistically significant” is related to an implicit theory of randomness. The lecture closes by giving some practical advice about how to think through these concepts in your own domain.</p>

<p><strong>Barriers to Building a Data Practice in Government</strong>
<em>Led by Beth Blauer</em></p>

<p>During this session we will discuss the risks of collecting and using data in government  including financial costs, lack of institutional readiness, lack of skills and available talent, lack of a governance framework, ethical concerns including privacy, security, confidentiality, and questions of how to share data between organizations and with researchers. We discuss strategies for overcoming these risks.</p>

<p><strong>Data Collaboratives and Corporate Data Philanthropy</strong>
<em>Led by Stefaan Verhulst</em></p>

<p>Much of the data that would be valuable to access and analyze resides with the private sector—in the form of, for instance, Web clicks, online purchases, sensor data, and call data records. With consumers connected to more and more platforms as well as the increasing prevalence of sensing technologies (i.e. the Internet of Things), data on how people and societies behave is becoming even more privately owned. In this session, we discuss private sources of data to solve public problems and best practices for how data can be shared between private and public organizations.</p>
